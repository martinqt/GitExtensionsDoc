msgid "There is 2 different cases, and consequently 2 way to do it, with git when we want to modify the history: - Modify the last commit of the current branch with doing an amend - Modify a older commit with doing a ``interactive rebase``"
msgstr ""

#: ..\modify_history.rst:8
msgid "Note: There are 2 things to understand when working with the history with git: - As git only create immutable commits (sealed by the sha1), \"modifying\" a commit is in fact creating a new commit more or less similar. - Consequently, the entire history of children following the changed commit will be different."
msgstr ""

#: ..\modify_history.rst:12
msgid "So, except if the history has not been already push, or if you have good reasons, that is a bad practice to change the history"
msgstr ""

#: ..\modify_history.rst:12
msgid "because you will mess the history of others developers."

msgid "Modify the last commit"
msgstr ""

#: ..\modify_history.rst:17
msgid "The easiest way to modify the history is to modify the last commit made by doing what is called an ``amend``. To do that, open the commit windows and check the option \"Amend commit\". If the commit message text area was empty, it is now filled with the message of the last commit. You could now just update the commit message and commit or also add some more changes in the staging area to add them to the commit."

msgid "Doing an interactive rebase"
msgstr ""

#: ..\modify_history.rst:33
msgid "First, you should create a commit containing the changes you want to add to a previous commit (or know an existing commit that contains this changes)."
msgstr ""

#: ..\modify_history.rst:36
msgid "Then use the `rebase` feature in interactive mode on a base commit older than the one that you want to modify."
msgstr ""

#: ..\modify_history.rst:40
msgid "Check the option `interactive` and click on `Rebase` to launch the process."

#: ..\modify_history.rst:44
msgid "You will be prompted by a text editor displaying all the commits that will be rebased"

msgid "write `s` or `squash` in front of a commit to meld the commit with the previous commit and with rewriting the commit message."

#: ..\modify_history.rst:56
msgid "Often, we will use interactive rebase to move the line and squash or fixup commits to modify the history."

msgid "Once we did the changes, save and close the editor to let git do the rebase."

msgid "Using autosquash rebase feature"
msgstr ""

#: ..\modify_history.rst:63
msgid "There is an option to facilitate the use of the ``interactive rebase`` when you know, at the moment of doing a commit that the changes introduced by this commit should have been made in an older commit (the case of a `fixup` or `squash`)."

msgid "Launch the rebase by clicking on `Rebase`."
msgstr ""

#: ..\modify_history.rst:89
msgid "The interactive rebase will process the same way but with a major difference! When enabling the `Autosquash` option, git will automatically reorder the commits lines and write the good actions in front of the commits when it will open the text editor. You normally have just to close the editor (except if you want to do additional changes). And let git do the rebase."
