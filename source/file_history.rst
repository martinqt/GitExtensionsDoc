File history
============

To display the single file history, right click on a file name in the :ref:`browse-repository` ``File tree`` or in the ``Diff`` tab and select ``File history`` or ``Blame``.
The single file history viewer shows all revisions of a single file. (This is available for submodules too, but the information is mostly not interesting.)
