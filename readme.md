The current documentation can be viewed here: https://git-extensions-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

PDF and other formats can be downloaded here: https://readthedocs.org/projects/git-extensions-documentation/downloads/

**Note:** Only the HTML format is "supported" (i.e. from the display point of view). Other formats might have layout issues
but the content remains the same for all formats, whether or not you build it locally (provided your local clone is 
up to date).

Build
-----

To generate the documentation, you need to have Sphinx installed: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html#windows
The following installs and build the GE html documentation for any Python package with PIP included:
 - pip install -U sphinx
 - sphinx-build -b html -d build/doctrees source build/html

### HTML
Simply run `make-html.cmd`. You can also use `make-singlehtml.cmd` to generate a single HTML
file. The `make_and_start_Browser.cmd` is an alias of `make-html.cmd` that will open in your
default browser the documentation main index.

### HTML Help Files
**Warning:** This format is not completely supported (i.e. you can generate it but we don't 
guarantee as good a display quality as for HTML).

Download HTML Help Workshop (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21138).

To build the file, use `make-HTMLHelp.cmd`

### PDF
**Warning:** This format is not completely supported (i.e. you can generate it but we don't 
guarantee as good a display quality as for HTML).

To use the PDF builder, you'll need to install:

* rst2pdf `easy_install rst2pdf`
* pil `easy_install pil`

Also add `,'rst2pdf.pdfbuilder'` to the source/conf.py file at the line 28. Then run `make.cmd pdf`.

Version update
--------------

 * Set version in source/conf.py
 * Create release branch release/x.y (this is the default from the GE About menu for released versions, 'master' for development builds).
 * When releasing final, push 'latest' branch to release/x.y commit (this branch is the default when browsing https://git-extensions-documentation.readthedocs.io/).
 * Edit versions in https://readthedocs.org/projects/git-extensions-documentation/versions/ (admin privileges needed). Keep relevant versions active.
 * Trigger a build for changed versions
